# Change log

All notable changes to the LaunchDarkly Client-side SDK for Vue will be documented in this file. See also the [JavaScript SDK changelog](https://github.com/launchdarkly/js-client-sdk/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md), since the Vue SDK inherits all of the underlying functionality of the JavaScript SDK; this file covers only changes that are specific to the Vue interface. This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).
